## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Commands that require different intents:

#### Server Members Intent:
```javascript
// Example: /ban command requiring member data
const { SlashCommandBuilder, PermissionFlagsBits } = require('discord.js');

module.exports = {
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName('ban')
        .setDescription('Ban a user from the server')
        .addUserOption(option =>
            option.setName('user')
                .setDescription('The user to ban')
                .setRequired(true)) // This requires member data access
        .setDefaultMemberPermissions(PermissionFlagsBits.BanMembers),
    
    async execute(interaction) {
        const target = interaction.options.getMember('user'); // Requires member data
        // ... moderation logic
    }
};
```

#### Presence Intent:
```javascript
// Example: Status tracking command
module.exports = {
    name: 'status',
    description: 'Check member status and activity',
    
    run: async (client, message, args) => {
        const member = message.mentions.members.first();
        if (member) {
            const status = member.presence?.status || 'Unknown'; // Requires presence intent
            const activity = member.presence?.activities[0]?.name || 'No activity';
            message.reply(`${member.user.tag} is ${status} - ${activity}`);
        }
    }
};
```

#### Message Content Intent:
```javascript
// Example: Prefix-based command
module.exports = {
    name: 'ban',
    description: 'Ban a user using prefix command',
    
    run: async (client, message, args) => {
        // This requires message content intent to read the command
        const user = message.mentions.users.first();
        const reason = args.slice(1).join(' ');
        
        if (!user) {
            return message.reply('Please mention a user to ban.');
        }
        
        // Ban logic here
        message.reply(`Banned ${user.tag} for: ${reason}`);
